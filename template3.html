            Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

            Where does he come from? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. God dammit, I'm late. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Where does he come from?

            Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? What was it, George, bird watching? Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Hello.
